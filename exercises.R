# Exercise 1: Write a program to map proper formats for CMSTDTC and CMENDTC from raw CM dataset. 



# Exercise 2: Write a program to create Unique Subject Identifier variable and Sequence variable. 




# Exercise 3: Write a program to calculate Study Day variable. (CMSTDTC, CMENDTC) 




# Exercise 4: Take the concomitant medication data. 
# The sample source data also has ATC coded variables for the medication names.
# Plan the mapping of these into cm_mapping.xlsx excel file


# Exercise 5: Compare the mapping you proposed for exercise 4 with the mapping file given by Binod.


# 
# Exercise 6. After completing the comparison, create CM and SUPPCM datasets with a single cm.sas program. After that, validate the CM & SUPPCM datasets with provided dataset (will be available in SDTM folder upon request). Finally, save your program.
